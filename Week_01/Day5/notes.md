ðŸ”  What is SOLID?
SOLID is an acronym that represents five core principles of object-oriented design. These principles help developers build software that is:

- Easy to maintain
- Easy to understand
- Flexible to change
- Less prone to bugs
#### SOLID Long Form : 
| Letter | Principle             | FullForm                          |
|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| S      | Single Responsibility | A class should have only one reason to change |
| O      | Open/Closed           | Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification |
| L      | Liskov Substitution   | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types |
| I      | Interface Segregation | No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use |
| D      | Dependency Inversion  | High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions |

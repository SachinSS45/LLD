# SOLID Principle
ðŸ”  What is SOLID?
SOLID is an acronym that represents five core principles of object-oriented design. These principles help developers build software that is:

- Easy to maintain
- Easy to understand
- Flexible to change
- Less prone to bugs
#### SOLID Long Form : 
| Letter | Principle             | FullForm                          |
|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| S      | Single Responsibility | A class should have only one reason to change |
| O      | Open/Closed           | Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification |
| L      | Liskov Substitution   | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types |
| I      | Interface Segregation | No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use |
| D      | Dependency Inversion  | High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions |

#### ðŸŽ¯ Why Do We Need SOLID Principles?
##### âœ… 1. Maintainability
- Changes in one part of the system won't break other parts.
- Makes debugging and enhancements easier.

###### âœ… 2. Scalability
- Easier to add new features without rewriting existing code.

###### âœ… 3. Testability
- Makes unit testing simpler by isolating responsibilities.

###### âœ… 4. Readability
- Code is easier to understand, especially in large teams.

###### âœ… 5. Loose Coupling & High Cohesion
- Encourages designing systems with modular and reusable components.
